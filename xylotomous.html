                <h1> Introduction </h1>
                <p> Hi I'm Nathan. </p>
                <p> I'm a second year ACTL Co-op student at UNSW. Since I'm restricted to a single degree,
                    my goal is to learn as much about compsci and software dev as I can, as the ACTL COMP double was my original plan.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    This project itself was already a great introduction to HTML as I learned how to structure the different classes etc. and 
                    I learnt a decent bit about structuring with HTML. For background, my coding experience is limited basically to only
                    Python (for Leetcode) and small R projects for ACTL, which don't really require much programming structure compared to 
                    how I had to make sure all the divs were properly aligned here. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    I usually split my free time between coding, league of legends, and any competitive mobile game. 
                </p>
            </div>
        

            <div class = 'content-section' id = 'interests'>
                <h1> Interests </h1>
                <p> As I mentioned earlier, my interests are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Leetcode: Designing algos are pretty cool, still working on being good at it though </li>
                    <li> League of legends: Renek/AA player trying to get back to dia peak. Ever since hullbreaker was changed I live and die by the fact that toplane has zero impact </li>
                    <li> Mobile games: CR - Mortar Cannon cart, COC - RC charge,  Brawl stars, Honour of Kings. Honestly, any mainstream high skill expression game I probably have played at some point </li>
                    <li> I also enjoy training some calisthenics right now too </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class = 'content-section' id = 'projects'>
                <h1> Projects </h1>
                <p> This is an interesting topic because I struggle with long-term projects. I typically find the aesthetics part of project development tedious 
                    and if I'm going to be honest, this is the part I need the most help with as I struggle with creative design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My github is just a repo of my leetcode solutions as I enjoy solving problems. With that being said, I still want to learn software development
                    as that is the real-world application of coding, whereas at the end of the day algos are just fun. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll leave the link to my Github here if you want to check it out: <a href = 'https://github.com/zylotomous'> https://github.com/zylotomous </a>

            <div class = 'content-section' id = 'other'>
                <h1> Other </h1>
                <p> Not too much to say here, apart from the fact that I learnt some basic HTML, CSS and JS to make this website.
                    Even then, I spent a lot of time to get this far, trying to understand JS when I've coded exclusively in Python 
                    and R.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Other sports I used to play include waterpolo, basketball, although nowadays the 
                    mundanity of modern life post-high school has left me time to pursue other interests. 
                </p>   
                    Philosophy has also been something I enjoy from time to time, part of me actually wanted to study it at uni,
                    but then I would be homeless.
                <p>
                    I can only thank my English teacher for introducing me to Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray,
                    as well as my Year 12 experiences with TS Eliot and Albert Camus.
