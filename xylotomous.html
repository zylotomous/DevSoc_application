            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p> Hi I'm Nathan. </p>
            <p> I'm a second year ACTL Co-op student at UNSW. Since I'm restricted to a single degree,
                my goal is to learn as much about compsci and software dev as I can, as the ACTL COMP double was my original plan.
                I usually split my free time between coding, league, and any competitive mobile game. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class = 'content-section' id = 'interests'>
            <h1> Interests </h1>
            <p> As I mentioned earlier, my interests are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Leetcode: Designing algos are pretty cool, still working on being good at it though </li>
                <li> League of legends: Renek/AA player trying to get back to dia peak. Ever since hullbreaker was changed I live and die by the fact that toplane has zero impact </li>
                <li> Mobile games: CR - Mortar Cannon cart, COC - RC charge,  Brawl stars, Honour of Kings. Honestly, any mainstream high skill expression game I probably have played at some point </li>
                <li> I also enjoy training some calisthenics right now too </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class = 'content-section' id = 'projects'>
            <h1> Projects </h1>
            <p> This is an interesting topic because I struggle with long-term projects. I typically find the aesthetics part of project development tedious 
                and if I'm going to be honest, this is the part I need the most help with as I struggle with creative design. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My github is just a repo of my leetcode solutions as I enjoy solving problems. With that being said, I still want to learn software development
                as that is the real-world application of coding, whereas at the end of the day algos are just fun. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll leave the link to my Github here if you want to check it out: <a href = 'https://github.com/zylotomous'> https://github.com/zylotomous </a>
            </p>
            
        </div>

        <div class = 'content-section' id = 'other'>
            <h1> Other </h1>
            <p> Not too much to say here, apart from the fact that I learnt some basic HTML, CSS and JS to make this website.
                Even then, I spent a lot of time to get this far, trying to understand JS when I've coded exclusively in Python 
                and R.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Other sports I used to play include waterpolo, basketball, although nowadays the 
                mundanity of modern life post-high school has left me time to pursue other interests. 
            </p>   
                Philosophy has also been something I enjoy from time to time, part of me actually wanted to study it at uni,
                but then I would be homeless.
            <p>
                I can only thank my English teacher for introducing me to Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray,
                as well as my Year 12 experiences with TS Eliot and Albert Camus.
            </p>
